Several methods were used to profile the /info route of the current server. Here are some insights: 
1) Median response rate was 424.2 miliseconds.
2) Over 11K different ticks (most of them in C++) ocurred while performing the 1000 GET requests we tested.
3) The flame graph obtained via autocannon shows typical asynchronic behaviour.
4) getCPU's was one of the processes that took the most time to execute.
